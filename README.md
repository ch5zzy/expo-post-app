# Expo Post App

This app provides an example for how to use React Native and TypeScript to
create an app that fetches posts and comments from a server.

## Setup

Run `npm i` in the project directory to install all packages. Also, install
[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your phone.

## Running the app

To run and test your app, run `npm run start` in your terminal. A QR code
should appear in the terminal. You can scan this QR code using the camera app
on your phone, and the link should open in Expo Go.
